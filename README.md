## üñºÔ∏è Example Usage

1. Drag and drop or select an image.
2. Click "Generate Caption".
3. View, copy, download, or share the generated caption.
4. Explore recent captions in the history panel.
5. Toggle "Show AI Attention Maps" to visualize how the AI interprets your image.

## üìù Shortcomings & Limitations

- **Dataset Size:** The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which is relatively small. As a result, captions may not generalize well to unseen or highly diverse images.
- **Model Accuracy:** The generated captions may sometimes be generic or inaccurate, especially for images outside the training distribution.
- **No Online Training:** The web app does not support retraining or fine-tuning the model from the UI.
- **Resource Usage:** Running the app and model inference may require significant memory and CPU, especially on large images.
- **Explainability:** Attention/Grad-CAM visualizations are illustrative and may not always perfectly reflect the model's reasoning.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

- **Change the Model:** Replace `models/model_9.h5` and `tokenizer.json` with your own trained model and tokenizer.
- **UI/UX Tweaks:** Edit `static/css/style.css` and `templates/index.html` for design changes.
- **Add Features:** Extend backend logic in `app.py` and frontend interactivity in `static/js/script.js`.

---

## üîí Security & Best Practices

- Only image files are accepted for upload.
- Uploaded files are stored in a temporary directory and can be auto-cleaned.
- Secure filename handling and file size limits are enforced.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Model Loading Errors:**  
  Ensure `models/model_9.h5` and `tokenizer.json` are present and compatible with your TensorFlow/Keras version.
- **Port Already in Use:**  
  Change the port in `app.py` (e.g., `app.run(port=5001)`).
- **Upload/Permission Issues:**  
  Ensure the `uploads/` directory exists and is writable.
