## 🌟 Features

### Core Functionality
- **AI-Powered Caption Generation:** Upload an image and get a meaningful caption generated by a deep learning model.
- **Drag & Drop Upload:** Effortless drag-and-drop or click-to-browse image upload.
- **Real-time Preview:** See your image before generating a caption.
- **Multiple Format Support:** JPG, PNG, and GIF images supported.

### User Experience

- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Loading Animations:** Smooth spinners and transitions.
- **Toast Notifications:** Real-time feedback for all actions.

### Advanced Features
- **Caption History:** View your recent captions with images in a dedicated panel.
- **Copy/Download/Share:** Instantly copy, download, or share captions (with Web Share API support).
- **Social Sharing:** Share captions and images directly to social platforms.
- **Explainability Toggle:** Option to visualize AI attention maps (Grad-CAM) for each word in the caption.
- **Interactive Word Highlighting:** Click on words to see which image regions influenced them.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**  
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`: Generate caption  
  - `Escape`: Remove current image
- **History Management:** Clear all history with a single click.

### Technical Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-project-image-caption-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure model and tokenizer files are present**
   - `models/model_9.h5` (pre-trained model)
   - `tokenizer.json` (tokenizer for text processing)

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   - Go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🖼️ Example Usage

1. Drag and drop or select an image.
2. Click "Generate Caption".
3. View, copy, download, or share the generated caption.
4. Explore recent captions in the history panel.
5. Toggle "Show AI Attention Maps" to visualize how the AI interprets your image.

## 📝 Shortcomings & Limitations

- **Dataset Size:** The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which is relatively small. As a result, captions may not generalize well to unseen or highly diverse images.
- **Model Accuracy:** The generated captions may sometimes be generic or inaccurate, especially for images outside the training distribution.
- **No Online Training:** The web app does not support retraining or fine-tuning the model from the UI.
- **Resource Usage:** Running the app and model inference may require significant memory and CPU, especially on large images.
- **Explainability:** Attention/Grad-CAM visualizations are illustrative and may not always perfectly reflect the model's reasoning.

---

## 🛠️ Customization

- **Change the Model:** Replace `models/model_9.h5` and `tokenizer.json` with your own trained model and tokenizer.
- **UI/UX Tweaks:** Edit `static/css/style.css` and `templates/index.html` for design changes.
- **Add Features:** Extend backend logic in `app.py` and frontend interactivity in `static/js/script.js`.

---

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- Only image files are accepted for upload.
- Uploaded files are stored in a temporary directory and can be auto-cleaned.
- Secure filename handling and file size limits are enforced.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Model Loading Errors:**  
  Ensure `models/model_9.h5` and `tokenizer.json` are present and compatible with your TensorFlow/Keras version.
- **Port Already in Use:**  
  Change the port in `app.py` (e.g., `app.run(port=5001)`).
- **Upload/Permission Issues:**  
  Ensure the `uploads/` directory exists and is writable.
